    <h2>How to Make Polish Pierogies </h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
    This pierogi recipe for Polish dumplings has been a family favorite from 
    generation to generation. We traditionally make these for Christmas, 
    but they can be made for any special event. 
    </p>
    <p>
    There's some work involved, but the outcome is rewarding! 
    You can pan-fry the boiled pierogies in butter for a crispy finish.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the dough: In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add softened butter (or oil), 
            water, and egg if using. Mix and knead until smooth and pliable. Cover and let rest for 
            at least 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the filling: Boil the potatoes until tender, then mash until smooth. In a skillet, 
            sauté onions gently in butter until translucent and soft. Combine mashed potatoes, 
            sautéed onions, and shredded cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness. 
            Cut out circles roughly 3 inches in diameter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a tablespoon or so of filling in the center of each circle. 
            Fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape, pressing the edges firmly to seal. 
            Crimp edges if desired to ensure they don't open during cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop pierogies in batches into boiling water. 
            When they float to the surface, cook for an additional 2-3 minutes and then remove with a slotted spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve warm, topped with sautéed onions and/or sour cream.
        </li>
    </ol>
